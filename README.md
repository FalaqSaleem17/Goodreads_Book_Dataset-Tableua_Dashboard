# Goodreads Book Dataset Dashboard

## Description
This interactive Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the Goodreads book dataset, comprising over 11.13K books, 6.64K authors, and 2.30K publishers.

Wodehouse top the list with 40 books each, while Vintage leads publishers with 318 books. Additionally, highly rated titles like Twilight and The Hobbit stand out with millions of rating counts. This dashboard allows users to explore trends, top contributors, and reader engagement in the literary world.
